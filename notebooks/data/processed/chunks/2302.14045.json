Abstract Ludwig Wittgenstein\u201d A big convergence of language, multimodal perception, action, and world model- ing is a key step toward arti\ufb01cial general intelligence. In this work, we introduce KOSMOS-12, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that can perceive general modalities, learn in context (i.e., few-shot), and follow instructions (i.e., zero-shot). Speci\ufb01cally, we train KOSMOS-1 from scratch on web-scale multi- modal corpora, including arbitrarily interleaved text and images, image-caption pairs, and text data. We evaluate various settings, including zero-shot, few-shot, and multimodal chain-of-thought prompting, on a wide range of tasks without any gradient updates or \ufb01netuning. Experimental results show that KOSMOS-1 achieves impressive performance on (i) language understanding, generation, and even OCR-free NLP (directly fed with document images), (ii) perception-language tasks, including multimodal dialogue, image captioning, visual question answering, and (iii) vision tasks, such as image recognition with descriptions (specifying classi\ufb01cation via text instructions). We also show that MLLMs can bene\ufb01t from cross-modal transfer, i.e., transfer knowledge from language to multimodal, and from multimodal to language. In addition, we introduce a dataset of Raven IQ test, which diagnoses the nonverbal reasoning capability of MLLMs. Figure 2: Selected examples generated from KOSMOS-1.

The LLM-based interface can be adapted to a task as long as we are able to transform the input and output into texts. For example, the input of the summarization task is a document and the output is its summary. So we can feed the input document into the language model and then produce the generated summary. Despite the successful applications in natural language processing, it is still struggling to natively use LLMs for multimodal data, such as image, and audio. Being a basic part of intelligence, multimodal perception is a necessity to achieve arti\ufb01cial general intelligence, in terms of knowledge acquisition and grounding to the real world. More importantly, unlocking multimodal input [TMC+21, HSD+22, WBD+22, ADL+22, AHR+22, LLSH23] greatly widens the applications of language models to more high-value areas, such as multimodal machine learning, document intelligence, and robotics. In this work, we introduce KOSMOS-1, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that can perceive general modalities, follow instructions (i.e., zero-shot learning), and learn in context (i.e., few-shot learning). The goal is to align perception with LLMs, so that the models are able to see and talk. To be speci\ufb01c, we follow METALM [HSD+22] to train the KOSMOS-1 model from scratch. As shown in Figure 1, a Transformer-based language model is regarded as the general-purpose interface, and perception modules are docked with the language model. We train the model on web- scale multimodal corpora, i.e., text data, arbitrarily interleaved images and texts, and image-caption pairs. In addition, we calibrate the instruction-following capability across modalities by transferring language-only data. As shown in Table 1, the KOSMOS-1 model natively supports language, perception-language, and vision tasks. We also present some generated examples in Figure 2 and 3. In addition to various natural language tasks, the KOSMOS-1 models natively handle a wide range of perception-intensive tasks, spanning visual dialogue, visual explanation, visual question answering, image captioning, simple math equation, OCR, and zero-shot image classi\ufb01cation with descriptions. We also build 4 an IQ test benchmark following Raven\u2019s Progressive Matrices [JR03, CJS90], which evaluates the capability of nonverbal reasoning for MLLMs.",

We also build 4 an IQ test benchmark following Raven\u2019s Progressive Matrices [JR03, CJS90], which evaluates the capability of nonverbal reasoning for MLLMs. The examples show that the native support of multimodal perception enables new opportunities to apply LLMs to new tasks. Moreover, we show that MLLMs achieve better commonsense reasoning performance compared with LLMs, which indicates cross-modal transfer helps knowledge acquisition. The key takeaways are as follows: From LLMs to MLLMs. Properly handling perception is a necessary step toward arti\ufb01cial general intelligence. The capability of perceiving multimodal input is critical to LLMs. First, multimodal perception enables LLMs to acquire commonsense knowledge beyond text descriptions. Second, aligning perception with LLMs opens the door to new tasks, such as robotics, and document intelli- gence. Third, the capability of perception uni\ufb01es various APIs, as graphical user interfaces are the most natural and uni\ufb01ed way to interact with. For example, MLLMs can directly read the screen or extract numbers from receipts. We train the KOSMOS-1 models on web-scale multimodal corpora, which ensures that the model robustly learns from diverse sources. We not only use a large-scale text corpus but also mine high-quality image-caption pairs and arbitrarily interleaved image and text documents from the web. Language models as general-purpose interfaces. Following the philosophy proposed in METALM [HSD+22], we regard language models as a universal task layer. Because of the open- ended output space, we are able to unify various task predictions as texts. Moreover, natural-language instructions and action sequences (such as programming language) can be well handled by language models. LLMs also serve as basic reasoners [WWS+22], which is complementary to perception modules on complex tasks. So it is natural to align world, action, and multimodal perception with the general-purpose interface, i.e., language models. New capabilities of MLLMs. As shown in Table 1, apart from the capabilities found in previous LLMs [BMR+20, CND+22], MLLMs enable new usages and possibilities. First, we can conduct zero- and few-shot multimodal learning by using natural language instructions and demonstration examples. Second, we observe promising signals of nonverbal reasoning by evaluating the Raven IQ test, which measures the \ufb02uid reasoning ability of humans. Third, MLLMs naturally support multi-turn interactions for general modalities, such as multimodal dialogue. 2 KOSMOS-1: A Multimodal Large Language Model As shown in Figure 1, KOSMOS-1 is a multimodal language model that can perceive general modalities, follow instructions, learn in context, and generate outputs. Given the previous context, the model learns to generate texts in an auto-regressive manner. Speci\ufb01cally, the backbone of KOSMOS-1 is a Transformer-based causal language model. Apart from text, other modalities are embedded and fed into the language model. The Transformer decoder serves as a general-purpose",

Given the previous context, the model learns to generate texts in an auto-regressive manner. Speci\ufb01cally, the backbone of KOSMOS-1 is a Transformer-based causal language model. Apart from text, other modalities are embedded and fed into the language model. The Transformer decoder serves as a general-purpose interface to multimodal input. We train KOSMOS-1 on multimodal corpora, including monomodal data, cross- modal paired data, and interleaved multimodal data. Once the models are trained, we can directly evaluate the models in zero-shot and few-shot settings on both language tasks and multimodal tasks. 2.1 Input Representation The Transformer decoder perceives general modalities in a uni\ufb01ed way. For input format, we \ufb02atten input as a sequence decorated with special tokens. Speci\ufb01cally, we use <s> and </s> to denote start- and end-of-sequence. The special tokens <image> and </image> indicate the beginning and end of encoded image embeddings. For example, \u201c<s> document </s>\u201d is a text input, and \u201c<s> paragraph <image> Image Embedding </image> paragraph </s>\u201d is an interleaved image-text input. Table 21 in Appendix shows some examples of input format. An embedding module is used to encode both text tokens and other input modalities into vectors. Then the embeddings are fed into the decoder. For input tokens, we use a lookup table to map them into embeddings. For the modalities of continuous signals (e.g., image, and audio), it is also feasible to represent inputs as discrete code and then regard them as \u201cforeign languages\u201d [WBD+22, WCW+23]. In this work, following [HSD+22], we employ a vision encoder as the embedding module for input 5 images. In addition, Resampler [ADL+22] is used as an attentive pooling mechanism to reduce the number of image embeddings. 2.2 Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) After obtaining the embeddings of an input sequence, we feed them into the Transformer-based decoder. The left-to-right causal model processes the sequence in an auto-regressive manner, which produces the next token by conditioning on past timesteps. The causal masking is used to mask out future information. A softmax classi\ufb01er upon Transformer is used to generate tokens over the vocabulary. MLLMs serve as general-purpose interfaces [HSD+22] that can perform interactions with both natural language and multimodal input. The framework is \ufb02exible to handle various data types, as long as we can represent input as vectors. MLLMs combine the best of two worlds. First, the language models naturally inherit the capabilities of in-context learning and instruction following. Second, perception is aligned with language models by training on multimodal corpora. The implementation is based on the library TorchScale3 [MWH+22], which is designed for large- scale model training. Compared with the standard Transformer architecture, we include the following modi\ufb01cations: MAGNETO We use MAGNETO [WMH+22], a Transformer variant, as the backbone architecture.

Compared with the standard Transformer architecture, we include the following modi\ufb01cations: MAGNETO We use MAGNETO [WMH+22], a Transformer variant, as the backbone architecture. MAGNETO has better training stability and superior performance across modalities. It introduces an extra LayerNorm to each sublayer (i.e., multi-head self-attention, and feed-forward network). The method has a theoretically derived initialization method [WMD+22] to improve the optimization fundamentally, which allows us to effectively scale up the models without pain. XPOS We employ XPOS [SDP+22] relative position encoding for better long-context modeling. The method can better generalize to different lengths, i.e., training on short while testing on longer sequences. Moreover, XPOS optimizes attention resolution so that the position information can be captured more precisely. The method XPOS is ef\ufb01cient and effective in both interpolation and extrapolation settings. 2.3 Training Objective The KOSMOS-1 training is conducted on web-scale multimodal corpora, including monomodal data (e.g., text corpus), cross-modal paired data (e.g., image-caption pairs), and interleaved multimodal data (e.g., documents of arbitrarily interleaved images and texts). To be speci\ufb01c, we use monomodal data for representation learning. For example, language modeling with text data pretrains instruction following, in-context learning, and various language tasks. Moreover, cross-modal pairs and inter- leaved data learn to align the perception of general modalities with language models. Interleaved data also naturally \ufb01t in the multimodal language modeling task. We present more details of training data collection in Section 3.1. The models are trained with the next-token prediction task, i.e., learning to generate the next token depending on the previous context. The training objective is to maximize the log-likelihood of tokens in examples. Notice that only discrete tokens, such as text tokens, are accounted for in the training loss. Multimodal language modeling is a scalable way to train the models. More importantly, the emergence of various capabilities makes the training task favorable for downstream applications. 3 Model Training 3.1 Multimodal Training Data The models are trained on web-scale multimodal corpora. The training datasets consist of text corpora, image-caption pairs, and interleaved data of images and texts. 3https://github.com/microsoft/torchscale 6 Text Corpora We train our model with The Pile [GBB+20] and Common Crawl (CC). The Pile is a massive English text dataset built for training large-scale language models, which is produced from a variety of data sources. We exclude data splits from GitHub, arXiv, Stack Exchange, and PubMed Central. We also include the Common Crawl snapshots (2020-50 and 2021-04) datasets, CC-Stories, and RealNews datasets [SPP+19, SPN+22]. The entire datasets have been purged of duplicate and near-duplicate documents, as well as \ufb01ltered to exclude downstream task data. Refer to Appendix B.1.1 for detailed descriptions of training text corpora. Image-Caption Pairs The image-caption pairs are constructed from several datasets, including English LAION-2B [SBV+22], LAION-400M [SVB+21], COYO-700M [BPK+22], and Conceptual Captions [SDGS18, CSDS21].",

Image-Caption Pairs The image-caption pairs are constructed from several datasets, including English LAION-2B [SBV+22], LAION-400M [SVB+21], COYO-700M [BPK+22], and Conceptual Captions [SDGS18, CSDS21]. English LAION-2B, LAION-400M, and COYO-700M are collected from web pages of the Common Crawl web data by extracting image sources and the corresponding alt-text. Conceptual Captions are also from internet web pages. More details can be found in Appendix B.1.2. Interleaved Image-Text Data We collect interleaved multimodal data from the Common Crawl snapshot, which is a publicly available archive of web pages. We use a \ufb01ltering process to select about 71M web pages from the original 2B web pages in the snapshot. We then extract the text and images from the HTML of each selected web page. For each document, we limit the number of images to \ufb01ve to reduce noise and redundancy. We also randomly discard half of the documents that only have one image to increase the diversity. We provide more details about the data collection process in Appendix B.1.3. By using this corpus, we enable KOSMOS-1 to handle interleaved text and image and improve its few-shot ability. 3.2 Training Setup The MLLM component has 24 layers with 2,048 hidden dimensions, 8,192 FFN intermediate size, and 32 attention heads, resulting in about 1.3B parameters. We use Magneto\u2019s initialization for optimization stability. For faster convergence, the image representation is obtained from a pretrained CLIP ViT-L/14 model with 1,024 feature dimensions. The images are preprocessed into 224\u00d7224 resolution during training. We freeze the parameters of the CLIP model except for the last layer during training. The total number of parameters of KOSMOS-1 is about 1.6B. More details about hyperparameters can be found in Appendix A. We use a batch size of 1.2 million tokens (0.5 million tokens from text corpora, 0.5 million tokens from image-caption pairs, and 0.2 million tokens from interleaved data) and train KOSMOS-1 for 300k steps, corresponding to about 360 billion tokens. We adopt the AdamW optimizer with \u03b2 = (0.9, 0.98). We set the weight decay to 0.01 and the dropout rate to 0.1. The learning rate increases to 2e-4 for the \ufb01rst 375 warming-up steps and decays linearly to 0 for the rest of the training steps. We use SentencePiece [KR18] to tokenize the text. We preprocess the data in the \u201cfull-sentence\u201d format [LOG+19], which packs each input sequence with full sentences that are sampled continuously from one or more documents. 3.3 Language-Only Instruction Tuning In order to better align KOSMOS-1 with human instructions, we perform language-only instruction tuning [LHV+23, HSLS22]. Speci\ufb01cally, we continue-train the model with the instruction data in the format of (instructions, inputs, and outputs). The instruction data is language-only, which is",

Speci\ufb01cally, we continue-train the model with the instruction data in the format of (instructions, inputs, and outputs). The instruction data is language-only, which is mixed with training corpora. The tuning process is conducted as language modeling. Notice that instructions and inputs are not accounted for in the loss. Section 4.9.1 shows that the improvements in the instruction-following capability can transfer across modalities. We combine Unnatural Instructions [HSLS22] and FLANv2 [LHV+23] as our instruction dataset. Unnatural Instructions is a dataset that was created by using a large language model to generate instructions for various natural language processing tasks. It has 68,478 instruction-input-output triplets in its core dataset. FLANv2 is a collection of datasets that cover diverse types of language understanding tasks, such as reading comprehension, commonsense reasoning, and closed-book question answering. We randomly select 54k examples of instructions from FLANv2 to augment our instruction dataset. Details of the training hyperparameter settings are described in Appendix A.2. 7 4 Evaluation MLLMs can handle both language tasks and perception-intensive tasks. We evaluate KOSMOS-1 on various types of tasks as follows: \u2022 Language tasks \u2013 Language understanding \u2013 Language generation \u2013 OCR-free text classi\ufb01cation \u2022 Cross-modal transfer \u2013 Commonsense reasoning \u2022 Nonverbal reasoning \u2013 IQ Test (Raven\u2019s Progressive Matrices) \u2022 Perception-language tasks \u2013 Image captioning \u2013 Visual question answering \u2013 Web page question answering \u2022 Vision tasks \u2013 Zero-shot image classi\ufb01cation \u2013 Zero-shot image classi\ufb01cation with descriptions 4.1 Perception-Language Tasks We evaluate the perception-language capability of KOSMOS-1 under vision-language settings. Specif- ically, we conduct zero-shot and few-shot experiments on two widely used tasks, including image captioning and visual question answering. Image captioning involves generating a natural language description of an image, while visual question answering aims to answer a natural language question with respect to an image. 4.1.1 Evaluation Setup We evaluate the caption generation on MS COCO Caption [LMB+14], and Flickr30k [YLHH14]. We use the test set of COCO Karpathy split [KFF17], which re-partitions the train2014 and val2014 images [LMB+14] into 113,287, 5,000, and 5,000 for the training set, validation set, and test set, respectively. We conduct an evaluation on Flickr30k\u2019s Karpathy split test set. The image resolution is 224\u00d7224. We use beam search to generate the captions, and the beam size is 5. In the few-shot settings, we randomly sample demonstrations from the training set. We use COCOEvalCap4 to compute CIDEr [VLZP15] and SPICE [AFJG16] scores as the evaluation metrics. We prompt KOSMOS-1 with \u201cAn image of\u201d for zero-shot and few-shot caption generation experiments. For visual question-answering tasks, we evaluate zero-shot and few-shot results on test-dev set of VQAv2 [GKSS+17] and test-dev set of VizWiz [GLS+18], respectively. The resolution of images is 224\u00d7224. We use greedy",

The resolution of images is 224\u00d7224. We use greedy search for the decoding. We follow the normalization rules of the VQAv2 evaluation code5 when computing the VQA accuracy. We evaluate the performance of VQA in an open-ended setting that KOSMOS-1 generates answers and stops at the </s> (\u201cend of sequence\u201d) token. The prompt is \u201cQuestion: {question} Answer: {answer}\u201d for visual question answering tasks. 4.1.2 Results Image Captioning Table 2 shows the zero-shot captioning performance on COCO Karpathy test split and Flickr30k test set. KOSMOS-1 achieves remarkable results in zero-shot setting on two image captioning datasets. Speci\ufb01cally, our model achieves a CIDEr score of 67.1 on the Flickr30k dataset, compared to 60.6 and 61.5 for the Flamingo-3B and Flamingo-9B models, respectively. Notably, our model is able to accomplish this feat with a smaller size of 1.6B, compared to Flamingo models.

Figure 4: Top: An example of Raven IQ test. Bottom: Evaluate KOSMOS-1 on Raven IQ test. The input prompt consists of the \ufb02attened image matrix and verbal instruction. We append each candidate image to the prompt separately and query the model if it is correct. The \ufb01nal prediction is the candidate that motivates the model to yield the highest probability of \u201cYes\u201d. 4.2 IQ Test: Nonverbal Reasoning Raven\u2019s Progressive Matrices [CJS90, JR03] is one of the most common tests to evaluate nonverbal reasoning. The capability of nonverbal reasoning is typically a re\ufb02ection of an individual\u2019s intelligence quotient (IQ). Figure 4 shows an example. Given eight images presented in a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix, the task is to identify the following element from six similar candidates. The models need to conduct zero-shot nonverbal reasoning without explicitly \ufb01ne-tuning. The Raven IQ test is analogous to in-context learning of language models, where the difference is whether the context is nonverbal or verbal. In order to infer the answers, the models have to recognize abstract concepts and identify the underlying patterns of given images. So the IQ task is a good testbed to benchmark the nonverbal in-context learning capability. 10 ?ABCDEFExample of IQ TestABCDEF\ud835\udc43( Yes | Input Prompt )Which option can complete the matrix?Here are eight images: Input PromptThe following image is:Is it correct?Is it correct?Is it correct?Is it correct?Is it correct?Is it correct?YesYesYesYesYesYes 4.2.1 Evaluation Setup To evaluate the KOSMOS-1 on zero-shot nonverbal reasoning,",

It consists of 50 examples collected from different websites6789. Each example has three (i.e., 2 \u00d7 2 matrix), four, or eight (i.e., 3 \u00d7 3 matrix) given images. The goal is to predict the next one. Each instance has six candidate images with a unique correct completion. We measure accuracy scores to evaluate the models. The evaluation dataset is available at https://aka.ms/kosmos-iq50. Figure 4 illustrates how to evaluate KOSMOS-1 on the Raven IQ test. The matrix-style images are \ufb02attened and fed into the models one-by-one. To enable the model to better understand the desired task, we also use a textual instruction \u201cHere are three/four/eight images:\u201d, \u201cThe following image is:\u201d, and \u201cIs it correct?\u201d for conditioning. We append each possible candidate to the context separately and compare the probability that the model outputs \u201cYes\u201d in a close-ended setting. The candidate that yields the largest probability is regarded as the prediction. 4.2.2 Results Table 6 shows the evaluation results on the IQ test dataset. Both KOSMOS-1 with and without language-only instruction tuning achieve 5.3% and 9.3% improvement respectively over the random baseline. The results indicate that KOSMOS-1 is able to perceive abstract conceptual patterns in a nonverbal context, and then deduce the following element across multiple choices. To the best of our knowledge, it is the \ufb01rst time that a model can perform such zero-shot Raven IQ tests. Although there is still a large performance gap between the current model and the average level of adults, KOSMOS-1 demonstrates the potential of MLLMs to perform zero-shot nonverbal reasoning by aligning perception with language models.

For example, during the Rendered SST-2 task, sentences from the Stanford Sentiment Treebank [SPW+13] dataset are rendered as images. The model is asked to predict the sentiment of the text within the images. The task evaluates a model\u2019s ability to read and comprehend the meaning of words and sentences directly from the images. 4.3.1 Evaluation Setup We evaluate OCR-free language understanding on the Rendered SST-2 [RKH+21] test set and HatefulMemes [KFM+20] validation set. We use accuracy as the metric for the Rendered SST-2 and report ROC AUC for the HatefulMemes dataset. We use the prompt \u201cQuestion: what is the sentiment of the opinion?

The task evaluates a model\u2019s ability to read and comprehend the meaning of words and sentences directly from the images. 4.3.1 Evaluation Setup We evaluate OCR-free language understanding on the Rendered SST-2 [RKH+21] test set and HatefulMemes [KFM+20] validation set. We use accuracy as the metric for the Rendered SST-2 and report ROC AUC for the HatefulMemes dataset. We use the prompt \u201cQuestion: what is the sentiment of the opinion? Answer: {answer}\u201d, where the answer is either positive or negative for the Rendered SST-2. For the HatefulMemes task, the prompt is \u201cQuestion: does this picture contain real hate speech? Answer: {answer}\u201d, where the answer is either yes or no. 4.3.2 Results As shown in Table 7, KOSMOS-1 achieves a ROC AUC of 63.9% for the HatefulMemes validation It outperforms CLIP ViT-L set and a test accuracy of 67.1% for the Rendered SST-2 test set. 6https://en.testometrika.com/intellectual/iq-test/ 7https://en.testometrika.com/intellectual/iq-test-for-kids-7-to-16-year-old/ 8https://iqpro.org/ 9https://iqhaven.com/matrix-g 11 and Flamingo-9B, which achieve AUCs of 63.3% and 57.0% on the HatefulMemes task. Note that Flamingo explicitly provides OCR text into the prompt, while KOSMOS-1 does not access any external tools or resources. This indicates that KOSMOS-1 has built-in abilities to read and comprehend the text in the rendered images.

We report accuracy scores. 4.4 Web Page Question Answering Web page question answering aims at \ufb01nding answers to questions from web pages. It requires the model to comprehend both the semantics and the structure of texts. The structure of the web page (such as tables, lists, and HTML layout) plays a key role in how the information is arranged and displayed. The task can help us evaluate our model\u2019s ability to understand the semantics and the structure of web pages. 4.4.1 Evaluation Setup We compare the performance on the Web-based Structural Reading Comprehension (WebSRC) dataset [CZC+21]. For comparisons, we train a language model (LLM) on the same text corpora with the same training setup as in KOSMOS-1. The LLM takes the text extracted from the web page as input. Its template of the prompt is \u201cGiven the context below from web page, extract the answer from the given text like this: Qusestion: Who is the publisher of this book? Answer: Penguin Books Ltd. Context: {WebText} Q: {question} A: {answer} \u201d, where the {WebText} presents the text extracted from the web page. Besides using the same prompt, KOSMOS-1 prepends the image before the prompt. Two example images from WebSRC are shown in Appendix C.3. Following the original paper [CZC+21], we use exact match (EM) and F1 scores as our evaluation metrics. 4.4.2 Results The experimental results are summarized in Table 8. We observe that KOSMOS-1 outperforms the LLM, indicating that KOSMOS-1 can bene\ufb01t from the layout and style information of web pages in images. In addition, we evaluate the performance of",

We observe that KOSMOS-1 outperforms the LLM, indicating that KOSMOS-1 can bene\ufb01t from the layout and style information of web pages in images. In addition, we evaluate the performance of KOSMOS-1 without the extracted text in the prompt. It shows that extracted text has a contribution of +12.0/20.7 EM/F1 to KOSMOS-1, indicating that the bene\ufb01t from modeling images does not sacri\ufb01ce its language abilities.

Motivated by chain-of-thought prompting, we investigate a multimodal chain-of-thought prompting using KOSMOS-1. As illustrated in Figure 5, we break down perception-language tasks into two steps. In the \ufb01rst stage, given an image, we use a prompt to guide the model to generate a rationale. The model is then fed the rationale and a task-aware prompt to produce the \ufb01nal results. 4.5.1 Evaluation Setup We evaluate the ability of multimodal chain-of-thought prompting on the Rendered SST-2. We use the prompt \u201cIntroduce this picture in detail:\u201d to generate the content in the picture as the rationale. Then, we use the prompt \u201c{rationale} Question: what is the sentiment of the opinion? Answer: {answer}\u201d to predict the sentiment, where the answer is either positive or negative. 4.5.2 Results We conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of the multimodal chain-of-thought prompting. Table 9 shows that multimodal chain-of-thought prompting achieves a score of 72.9, which is 5.8 points higher than the standard prompting. By generating intermediate content, the model can recognize the text in the images and infer the sentiment of the sentences more correctly. 4.6 Zero-Shot Image Classi\ufb01cation We report the zero-shot image classi\ufb01cation performance on ImageNet [DDS+09]. Image classi\ufb01ca- tion comprehends an entire image as a whole and aims to assign a label to the image. We map each label to its category name in natural language. The model is prompted to predict the category name to perform zero-shot image classi\ufb01cation. 13 Standard PromptingIt is a robot that is holding up a cube that is the same color as the wall.The image is from the film, WALL-E, by Pixar Animation Studios.

Figure 6: In-context verbal descriptions can help KOSMOS-1 recognize visual categories better. 4.6.1 Evaluation Setup Given an input image, we concatenate the image with the prompt \u201cThe photo of the\u201d. The input is then fed into the model to obtain the category name of the image. We evaluate the model on ImageNet [DDS+09], which contains 1.28M training images and 50k validation images in 1k object categories. The prediction is classi\ufb01ed as correct if it is exactly the same as the ground-truth category name. The image resolution used for evaluation is 224\u00d7224. We use beam search to generate the category names and the beam size is 2. 4.6.2 Results As shown in Table 10, we report zero-shot results in both constrained and unconstrained settings. The difference between the two settings is whether we use the 1k object category names to constrain the decoding. KOSMOS-1 signi\ufb01cantly outperforms GIT [WYH+22] by 4.6% under the constrained setting and 2.1% under the unconstrained setting.

For the results with constraints, we use the 1k ImageNet object category names for constrained decoding. We report top-1 accuracy scores. 4.7 Zero-Shot Image Classi\ufb01cation with Descriptions The standard approach of image classi\ufb01cation as above is to prompt the model for the speci\ufb01c name of the object depicted in the image. However, there are also some classi\ufb01cation rules customized for different users and scenarios, such as the re\ufb01ned classi\ufb01cation of complex animal subspecies. We can utilize natural language descriptions to guide KOSMOS-1 to distinguish images in the zero-shot setting, which makes the decision process more interpretable. 14 Question:whatis the name of the woodpecker in the picture, three toed or downy?Answer:Input Prompt Completiondowny woodpeckerQuestion:whatis the name of the woodpecker in the picture?Answer:Input Prompt Description of three toed woodpecker: It has black and white stripes throughout the body and a yellow crown.Description of downy woodpecker: It has white spots on its black wings and",

Table 11: The detailed descriptions of different categories for in-context image classi\ufb01cation. 4.7.1 Evaluation Setup Following CUB [WBW+11], we construct a bird classi\ufb01cation dataset that contains images and natural-language descriptions of categories. The dataset has three groups of binary image classi\ufb01ca- tion. Each group contains two animal categories with similar appearances. Our goal is to classify images given the categories\u2019 descriptions. Table 11 presents the data samples. The \ufb01rst group is from [WBW+11], while the other two groups are collected from the website. Each category contains twenty images. The evaluation procedure is illustrated in Figure 6. For the zero-shot setting, we provide detailed descriptions of two speci\ufb01c categories and use the template \u201cQuestion:what is the name of {general category} in the picture? Answer:\u201d to prompt the model for the speci\ufb01c category name in an open- ended manner. To evaluate the effect of providing verbal descriptions in context, we also implement a zero-shot baseline without prompting descriptions. Instead, we provide the corresponding speci\ufb01c names in the prompt. 4.7.2 Results The evaluation results are shown in Table 12. We observe that providing descriptions in context can signi\ufb01cantly improve the accuracy of image classi\ufb01cation. The consistent improvements indicate that KOSMOS-1 can perceive the intentions of instructions and well align the concepts in language modality with visual features in vision modality.

Text inputs are directly fed into the models as in vanilla language models. 15 4.8.1 Evaluation Setup We train a language model (LLM) baseline with the same text corpora and training setup. We evaluate KOSMOS-1 and the LLM baseline on eight language tasks, including cloze and completion tasks (i.e, StoryCloze, HellaSwag), Winograd-style tasks (i.e, Winograd, Winogrande), commonsense reasoning (i.e, PIQA), and three datasets",

The detailed descriptions of these datasets are provided in Appendix C.2. We conduct experiments under zero-shot and few-shot settings. We evaluate each test example by randomly sampling examples from the training set as demonstrations. We set the number of shots to 0, 1, and 4 in our experiments. 4.8.2 Results Table 13 presents the in-context learning performance of language tasks. KOSMOS-1 achieves comparable or even better performance in cloze completion and commonsense reasoning tasks when compared to LLM. In terms of the average result across all these datasets, LLM performs better in zero-shot and one-shot settings, whereas our model performs better in few-shot (k = 4) settings. The results indicate that KOSMOS-1 also handles language-only tasks well and achieves favorable performance across datasets. In addition, Section 4.9.2 shows that MLLMs learn better visual commonsense knowledge compared with LLMs. Task StoryCloze HellaSwag Winograd Winogrande PIQA BoolQ CB COPA Average Zero-shot One-shot Few-shot (k = 4) LLM KOSMOS-1 LLM KOSMOS-1 LLM KOSMOS-1 72.9 50.4 71.6 56.7 73.2 56.4 39.3 68.0 61.1 72.1 50.0 69.8 54.8 72.9 56.4 44.6 63.0 60.5 72.9 50.2 71.2 56.7 73.0 55.1 41.1 69.0 61.2 72.2 50.0 68.4 54.5 72.5 57.2 48.2 64.0 60.9 73.1 50.4 70.9 57.0 72.6 58.7 42.9 69.0 61.8 72.3 50.3 69.8 55.7 72.3 59.2 53.6 64.0 62.2 Table 13: Performance comparisons of language tasks between KOSMOS-1 and LLM. We use the same textual data and training setup to reimplement a language model. Both models do not use instruction tuning for fair comparisons. 4.9 Cross-modal Transfer Cross-modal transferability allows a model to learn from one modality (such as text, image, audio, etc.) and transfer the knowledge to the other modalities. This skill can enable a model to perform various tasks across different modalities. In this part, we evaluate the cross-model transferability of KOSMOS-1 on several benchmarks. 4.9.1 Transfer from Language to Multimodal: Language-Only Instruction Tuning To evaluate the effect of language-only instruction tuning, we conduct an ablation study using four datasets: COCO, Flickr30k, VQAv2, and VizWiz. These datasets consist of image captioning and visual questions anwsering. The evaluation metrics are: CIDEr scores for COCO/Flickr30k and VQA accuracy for VQAv2/VizWiz. Table 14 shows the experimental results. Language-only instruction tuning boosts our model\u2019s performance by 1.9 points on Flickr30k, 4.3 points on VQAv2, and 1.3 points on VizWiz. Our experi- ments show that language-only instruction tuning can signi\ufb01cantly improve the model\u2019s instruction- following capabilities across modalities.

The results also indicate that our model can transfer the instruction-following capability from language to other modalities. 16 Model COCO Flickr30k VQAv2 VizWiz KOSMOS-1 w/o language-only instruction tuning 84.7 87.6 67.1 65.2 51.0 46.7 29.2 27.9 Table 14: Ablation study on language-only instruction tuning. We report CIDEr scores for COCO and Flickr30k, and VQA accuracy scores for VQAv2 and VizWiz. 4.9.2 Transfer from Multimodal to Language: Visual Commonsense Reasoning Visual commonsense reasoning tasks require an understanding of the properties of everyday objects in the real world, such as color, size, and shape. These tasks are challenging for language models because they may require more information about object properties than what is available in texts. To investigate the visual commonsense capabilities, we compare the zero-shot performance of KOSMOS-1 and LLM on visual commonsense reasoning tasks. Evaluation Setup We compare KOSMOS-1 and the LLM baseline on three object com- monsense reasoning datasets, RELATIVESIZE [BHCF16], MEMORYCOLOR [NHJ21] and COL- ORTERMS [BBBT12] datasets. Table 15 shows some examples of object size and color reasoning tasks. RELATIVESIZE contains 486 object pairs from 41 physical objects. The model is required to predict the size relation between two objects in a binary question-answering format with \u201cYes\u201d/\u201cNo\u201d answers. MEMORYCOLOR and COLORTERMS require the model to predict the color of objects from a set of 11 color labels in a multiple-choice format. We use only text as our input and do not include any images. We measure the accuracy of our model on these three datasets. Task Example Prompt Object / Pair Answer Object Size Reasoning Object Color Reasoning Is {Item1} larger than {Item2}? {Answer} The color of {Object} is? {Answer} (sofa, cat) the sky Yes blue Table 15: Evaluation examples of object size and color reasoning. Results Table 16 presents the zero-shot performance of KOSMOS-1 and LLM on visual common- sense reasoning tasks. KOSMOS-1 signi\ufb01cantly outperforms LLM by 1.5% on RELATIVESIZE, 14.7% on MEMORYCOLOR, and 9.7% on COLORTERMS dataset. The consistent improvements indicate that KOSMOS-1 bene\ufb01ts from the visual knowledge to complete the corresponding visual commonsense reasoning. The reason for KOSMOS-1\u2019s superior performance is that it has modality transferability, which enables the model to transfer visual knowledge to language tasks. On the contrary, LLM has to rely on textual knowledge and clues to answer visual commonsense questions, which limits its ability to reason about object properties.

On the contrary, LLM has to rely on textual knowledge and clues to answer visual commonsense questions, which limits its ability to reason about object properties.

Accuracy scores are reported. 5 Conclusion In this work, we introduce KOSMOS-1, a multimodal large language model that can perceive general modalities, follow instructions, and perform in-context learning. The models trained on web-scale 17 multimodal corpora achieve promising results across a wide range of language tasks and multimodal tasks. We show that going from LLMs to MLLMs enables new capabilities and opportunities. In the future, we would like to scale up KOSMOS-1 in terms of model size [MWH+22, WMH+22, CDH+22], and integrate the speech [WCW+23] capability into KOSMOS-1. In addition, KOSMOS-1 can be used as a uni\ufb01ed interface for multimodal learning, e.g., enabling using instructions and examples to control text-to-image generation.

The Pile is an 800 GB English text corpus combining 22 diverse sources. We select a subset with seven sources from The Pile. Common Crawl is also included in training corpora. Common Crawl takes snapshots of the web, which contains massive amounts of language data. Table 20 provides a full overview of the language datasets that were used in the training of KOSMOS-1 model. These data sources can be divided into the following three categories: \u2022 Academic: NIH Exporter \u2022 Internet: Pile-CC, OpenWebText2, Wikipedia (English), CC-2020-50, CC-2021-04, Realnews \u2022 Prose: BookCorpus2, Books3, Gutenberg [RPJ+20], CC-Stories Datasets Tokens (billion) Weight (%) Epochs OpenWebText2 CC-2021-04 Books3 CC-2020-50 Pile-CC Realnews Wikipedia BookCorpus2 Gutenberg (PG-19) CC-Stories NIH ExPorter 14.8 82.6 25.7 68.7 49.8 21.9 4.2 1.5 2.7 5.3 0.3 21.8% 17.7% 16.2% 14.7% 10.6% 10.2% 5.4% 1.1% 1.0% 1.0% 0.2% 1.47 0.21 0.63 0.21 0.21 0.46 1.29 0.75 0.38 0.19 0.75 Table 20: Language datasets used to train the KOSMOS-1 model. B.1.2 Image-Caption Pairs KOSMOS-1 is trained on image-caption pairs constructed from several datasets, including English LAION-2B [SBV+22], LAION-400M [SVB+21], COYO-700M [BPK+22] and Conceptual Cap- tions [SDGS18, CSDS21]. LAION-2B, LAION-400M, and COYO-700M datasets are extracted by parsing out image URLs and alt-texts of web pages from the Common Crawl web data. LAION-2B contains about 2B English image-caption pairs, LAION-400M consists of 400M English image- caption pairs, and COYO-700M has 700M English image-caption pairs. Conceptual Captions contains 15M English image-caption pairs and consists of two datasets: CC3M and CC12M, which are also collected from internet webpages using a Flume pipeline. For Conceptual Captions, we discard pairs whose captions contain special tags such as \u201c<PERSON>\u201d. B.1.3 Interleaved Data We collect a large corpus of 2 billion web pages from the snapshots of common crawls. To ensure quality and relevance, we apply several \ufb01ltering criteria. First, we discard any pages that are not written in English. Second, we discard any pages that do not have images interspersed in the text. Third, we discard any images that have a resolution lower than 64 by 64 pixels or that are single- colored. Fourth, we discard any text that is not meaningful or coherent, such as spam or gibberish. We use some heuristics to identify and remove gibberish text containing emoji symbols, hashtags, and URL links. After applying these \ufb01lters, we end up with about 71 million documents for training.
