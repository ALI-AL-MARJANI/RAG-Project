In this work, we introduce\nKOSMOS-12, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that can perceive\ngeneral modalities, learn in context (i.e., few-shot), and follow instructions (i.e.,\nzero-shot). Speci\ufb01cally, we train KOSMOS-1 from scratch on web-scale multi-\nmodal corpora, including arbitrarily interleaved text and images, image-caption\npairs, and text data. We evaluate various settings, including zero-shot, few-shot,\nand multimodal chain-of-thought prompting, on a wide range of tasks without\nany gradient updates or \ufb01netuning. Experimental results show that KOSMOS-1\nachieves impressive performance on (i) language understanding, generation, and\neven OCR-free NLP (directly fed with document images), (ii) perception-language\ntasks, including multimodal dialogue, image captioning, visual question answering,\nand (iii) vision tasks, such as image recognition with descriptions (specifying\nclassi\ufb01cation via text instructions).

The LLM-based interface can be adapted to a task as long as we\nare able to transform the input and output into texts. For example, the input of the summarization task\nis a document and the output is its summary. So we can feed the input document into the language\nmodel and then produce the generated summary.\n\nDespite the successful applications in natural language processing, it is still struggling to natively use\nLLMs for multimodal data, such as image, and audio. Being a basic part of intelligence, multimodal\nperception is a necessity to achieve arti\ufb01cial general intelligence, in terms of knowledge acquisition\nand grounding to the real world. More importantly, unlocking multimodal input [TMC+21, HSD+22,\nWBD+22, ADL+22, AHR+22, LLSH23] greatly widens the applications of language models to\nmore high-value areas, such as multimodal machine learning, document intelligence, and robotics.\n\nIn this work, we introduce KOSMOS-1, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that can\nperceive general modalities, follow instructions (i.e., zero-shot learning), and learn in context (i.e.,\nfew-shot learning). The goal is to align perception with LLMs, so that the models are able to see and\ntalk. To be speci\ufb01c, we follow METALM [HSD+22] to train the KOSMOS-1 model from scratch.\nAs shown in Figure 1, a Transformer-based language model is regarded as the general-purpose\ninterface, and perception modules are docked with the language model. We train the model on web-\nscale multimodal corpora, i.e., text data, arbitrarily interleaved images and texts, and image-caption\npairs. In addition, we calibrate the instruction-following capability across modalities by transferring\nlanguage-only data.\n\nAs shown in Table 1, the KOSMOS-1 model natively supports language, perception-language, and\nvision tasks. We also present some generated examples in Figure 2 and 3. In addition to various\nnatural language tasks, the KOSMOS-1 models natively handle a wide range of perception-intensive\ntasks, spanning visual dialogue, visual explanation, visual question answering, image captioning,\nsimple math equation, OCR, and zero-shot image classi\ufb01cation with descriptions. We also build\n\n4\n\n\fan IQ test benchmark following Raven\u2019s Progressive Matrices [JR03, CJS90], which evaluates\nthe capability of nonverbal reasoning for MLLMs. The examples show that the native support of\nmultimodal perception enables new opportunities to apply LLMs to new tasks. Moreover, we show\nthat MLLMs achieve better commonsense reasoning performance compared with LLMs, which\nindicates cross-modal transfer helps knowledge acquisition.\n\nThe key takeaways are as follows:\n\nFrom LLMs to MLLMs. Properly handling perception is a necessary step toward arti\ufb01cial general\nintelligence. The capability of perceiving multimodal input is critical to LLMs. First, multimodal\nperception enables LLMs to acquire commonsense knowledge beyond text descriptions. Second,\naligning perception with LLMs opens the door to new tasks, such as robotics, and document intelli-\ngence. Third, the capability of perception uni\ufb01es various APIs, as graphical user interfaces are the\nmost natural and uni\ufb01ed way to interact with. For example, MLLMs can directly read the screen or\nextract numbers from receipts. We train the KOSMOS-1 models on web-scale multimodal corpora,\nwhich ensures that the model robustly learns from diverse sources. We not only use a large-scale\ntext corpus but also mine high-quality image-caption pairs and arbitrarily interleaved image and text\ndocuments from the web.\n\nLanguage models as general-purpose interfaces. Following the philosophy proposed in\nMETALM [HSD+22], we regard language models as a universal task layer. Because of the open-\nended output space, we are able to unify various task predictions as texts. Moreover, natural-language\ninstructions and action sequences (such as programming language) can be well handled by language\nmodels. LLMs also serve as basic reasoners [WWS+22], which is complementary to perception\nmodules on complex tasks. So it is natural to align world, action, and multimodal perception with the\ngeneral-purpose interface, i.e., language models.\n\nNew capabilities of MLLMs. As shown in Table 1, apart from the capabilities found in previous\nLLMs [BMR+20, CND+22], MLLMs enable new usages and possibilities. First, we can conduct\nzero- and few-shot multimodal learning by using natural language instructions and demonstration\nexamples. Second, we observe promising signals of nonverbal reasoning by evaluating the Raven\nIQ test, which measures the \ufb02uid reasoning ability of humans. Third, MLLMs naturally support\nmulti-turn interactions for general modalities, such as multimodal dialogue.\n\n2 KOSMOS-1: A Multimodal Large Language Model\n\nAs shown in Figure 1, KOSMOS-1 is a multimodal language model that can perceive general\nmodalities, follow instructions, learn in context, and generate outputs. Given the previous context, the\nmodel learns to generate texts in an auto-regressive manner. Speci\ufb01cally, the backbone of KOSMOS-1\nis a Transformer-based causal language model. Apart from text, other modalities are embedded\nand fed into the language model. The Transformer decoder serves as a general-purpose interface to\nmultimodal input. We train KOSMOS-1 on multimodal corpora, including monomodal data, cross-\nmodal paired data, and interleaved multimodal data. Once the models are trained, we can directly\nevaluate the models in zero-shot and few-shot settings on both language tasks and multimodal tasks.\n\n2.1\n\nInput Representation\n\nThe Transformer decoder perceives general modalities in a uni\ufb01ed way. For input format, we \ufb02atten\ninput as a sequence decorated with special tokens. Speci\ufb01cally, we use <s> and </s> to denote start-\nand end-of-sequence. The special tokens <image> and </image> indicate the beginning and end of\nencoded image embeddings. For example, \u201c<s> document </s>\u201d is a text input, and \u201c<s> paragraph\n<image> Image Embedding </image> paragraph </s>\u201d is an interleaved image-text input. Table 21\nin Appendix shows some examples of input format.\n\nAn embedding module is used to encode both text tokens and other input modalities into vectors. Then\nthe embeddings are fed into the decoder. For input tokens, we use a lookup table to map them into\nembeddings. For the modalities of continuous signals (e.g., image, and audio), it is also feasible to\nrepresent inputs as discrete code and then regard them as \u201cforeign languages\u201d [WBD+22, WCW+23].\nIn this work, following [HSD+22], we employ a vision encoder as the embedding module for input\n\n5\n\n\fimages. In addition, Resampler [ADL+22] is used as an attentive pooling mechanism to reduce the\nnumber of image embeddings.\n\n2.2 Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)\n\nAfter obtaining the embeddings of an input sequence, we feed them into the Transformer-based\ndecoder. The left-to-right causal model processes the sequence in an auto-regressive manner, which\nproduces the next token by conditioning on past timesteps. The causal masking is used to mask\nout future information. A softmax classi\ufb01er upon Transformer is used to generate tokens over the\nvocabulary.\nMLLMs serve as general-purpose interfaces [HSD+22] that can perform interactions with both\nnatural language and multimodal input. The framework is \ufb02exible to handle various data types,\nas long as we can represent input as vectors. MLLMs combine the best of two worlds. First, the\nlanguage models naturally inherit the capabilities of in-context learning and instruction following.\nSecond, perception is aligned with language models by training on multimodal corpora.\nThe implementation is based on the library TorchScale3 [MWH+22], which is designed for large-\nscale model training. Compared with the standard Transformer architecture, we include the following\nmodi\ufb01cations:\n\nMAGNETO We use MAGNETO [WMH+22], a Transformer variant, as the backbone architecture.\nMAGNETO has better training stability and superior performance across modalities. It introduces an\nextra LayerNorm to each sublayer (i.e., multi-head self-attention, and feed-forward network). The\nmethod has a theoretically derived initialization method [WMD+22] to improve the optimization\nfundamentally, which allows us to effectively scale up the models without pain.\n\nXPOS We employ XPOS [SDP+22] relative position encoding for better long-context modeling.\nThe method can better generalize to different lengths, i.e., training on short while testing on longer\nsequences. Moreover, XPOS optimizes attention resolution so that the position information can\nbe captured more precisely. The method XPOS is ef\ufb01cient and effective in both interpolation and\nextrapolation settings.\n\n2.3 Training Objective\n\nThe KOSMOS-1 training is conducted on web-scale multimodal corpora, including monomodal data\n(e.g., text corpus), cross-modal paired data (e.g., image-caption pairs), and interleaved multimodal\ndata (e.g., documents of arbitrarily interleaved images and texts). To be speci\ufb01c, we use monomodal\ndata for representation learning. For example, language modeling with text data pretrains instruction\nfollowing, in-context learning, and various language tasks. Moreover, cross-modal pairs and inter-\nleaved data learn to align the perception of general modalities with language models. Interleaved data\nalso naturally \ufb01t in the multimodal language modeling task. We present more details of training data\ncollection in Section 3.1.\n\nThe models are trained with the next-token prediction task, i.e., learning to generate the next token\ndepending on the previous context. The training objective is to maximize the log-likelihood of tokens\nin examples. Notice that only discrete tokens, such as text tokens, are accounted for in the training\nloss. Multimodal language modeling is a scalable way to train the models. More importantly, the\nemergence of various capabilities makes the training task favorable for downstream applications.\n\n3 Model Training\n\n3.1 Multimodal Training Data\n\nThe models are trained on web-scale multimodal corpora. The training datasets consist of text corpora,\nimage-caption pairs, and interleaved data of images and texts.\n\n3https://github.com/microsoft/torchscale\n\n6\n\n\fText Corpora We train our model with The Pile [GBB+20] and Common Crawl (CC). The Pile\nis a massive English text dataset built for training large-scale language models, which is produced\nfrom a variety of data sources. We exclude data splits from GitHub, arXiv, Stack Exchange, and\nPubMed Central. We also include the Common Crawl snapshots (2020-50 and 2021-04) datasets,\nCC-Stories, and RealNews datasets [SPP+19, SPN+22]. The entire datasets have been purged of\nduplicate and near-duplicate documents, as well as \ufb01ltered to exclude downstream task data. Refer to\nAppendix B.1.1 for detailed descriptions of training text corpora.\n\nImage-Caption Pairs The image-caption pairs are constructed from several datasets, including\nEnglish LAION-2B [SBV+22], LAION-400M [SVB+21], COYO-700M [BPK+22], and Conceptual\nCaptions [SDGS18, CSDS21]. English LAION-2B, LAION-400M, and COYO-700M are collected\nfrom web pages of the Common Crawl web data by extracting image sources and the corresponding\nalt-text. Conceptual Captions are also from internet web pages. More details can be found in\nAppendix B.1.2.\n\nInterleaved Image-Text Data We collect interleaved multimodal data from the Common Crawl\nsnapshot, which is a publicly available archive of web pages. We use a \ufb01ltering process to select\nabout 71M web pages from the original 2B web pages in the snapshot. We then extract the text and\nimages from the HTML of each selected web page. For each document, we limit the number of\nimages to \ufb01ve to reduce noise and redundancy. We also randomly discard half of the documents that\nonly have one image to increase the diversity. We provide more details about the data collection\nprocess in Appendix B.1.3. By using this corpus, we enable KOSMOS-1 to handle interleaved text\nand image and improve its few-shot ability.\n\n3.2 Training Setup\n\nThe MLLM component has 24 layers with 2,048 hidden dimensions, 8,192 FFN intermediate size,\nand 32 attention heads, resulting in about 1.3B parameters. We use Magneto\u2019s initialization for\noptimization stability. For faster convergence, the image representation is obtained from a pretrained\nCLIP ViT-L/14 model with 1,024 feature dimensions. The images are preprocessed into 224\u00d7224\nresolution during training. We freeze the parameters of the CLIP model except for the last layer\nduring training. The total number of parameters of KOSMOS-1 is about 1.6B. More details about\nhyperparameters can be found in Appendix A.\n\nWe use a batch size of 1.2 million tokens (0.5 million tokens from text corpora, 0.5 million tokens\nfrom image-caption pairs, and 0.2 million tokens from interleaved data) and train KOSMOS-1 for\n300k steps, corresponding to about 360 billion tokens. We adopt the AdamW optimizer with\n\u03b2 = (0.9, 0.98). We set the weight decay to 0.01 and the dropout rate to 0.1. The learning rate\nincreases to 2e-4 for the \ufb01rst 375 warming-up steps and decays linearly to 0 for the rest of the\ntraining steps. We use SentencePiece [KR18] to tokenize the text. We preprocess the data in the\n\u201cfull-sentence\u201d format [LOG+19], which packs each input sequence with full sentences that are\nsampled continuously from one or more documents.\n\n3.3 Language-Only Instruction Tuning\n\nIn order to better align KOSMOS-1 with human instructions, we perform language-only instruction\ntuning [LHV+23, HSLS22]. Speci\ufb01cally, we continue-train the model with the instruction data in\nthe format of (instructions, inputs, and outputs). The instruction data is language-only, which is\nmixed with training corpora. The tuning process is conducted as language modeling. Notice that\ninstructions and inputs are not accounted for in the loss. Section 4.9.1 shows that the improvements\nin the instruction-following capability can transfer across modalities.\nWe combine Unnatural Instructions [HSLS22] and FLANv2 [LHV+23] as our instruction dataset.\nUnnatural Instructions is a dataset that was created by using a large language model to generate\ninstructions for various natural language processing tasks. It has 68,478 instruction-input-output\ntriplets in its core dataset. FLANv2 is a collection of datasets that cover diverse types of language\nunderstanding tasks, such as reading comprehension, commonsense reasoning, and closed-book\nquestion answering. We randomly select 54k examples of instructions from FLANv2 to augment our\ninstruction dataset. Details of the training hyperparameter settings are described in Appendix A.2.\n\n7\n\n\f4 Evaluation\n\nMLLMs can handle both language tasks and perception-intensive tasks. We evaluate KOSMOS-1 on\nvarious types of tasks as follows:\n\n\u2022 Language tasks\n\n\u2013 Language understanding\n\u2013 Language generation\n\u2013 OCR-free text classi\ufb01cation\n\n\u2022 Cross-modal transfer\n\n\u2013 Commonsense reasoning\n\n\u2022 Nonverbal reasoning\n\n\u2013 IQ Test (Raven\u2019s Progressive Matrices)\n\n\u2022 Perception-language tasks\n\u2013 Image captioning\n\u2013 Visual question answering\n\u2013 Web page question answering\n\n\u2022 Vision tasks\n\n\u2013 Zero-shot image classi\ufb01cation\n\u2013 Zero-shot image classi\ufb01cation with descriptions\n\n4.1 Perception-Language Tasks\n\nWe evaluate the perception-language capability of KOSMOS-1 under vision-language settings. Specif-\nically, we conduct zero-shot and few-shot experiments on two widely used tasks, including image\ncaptioning and visual question answering. Image captioning involves generating a natural language\ndescription of an image, while visual question answering aims to answer a natural language question\nwith respect to an image.\n\n4.1.1 Evaluation Setup\n\nWe evaluate the caption generation on MS COCO Caption [LMB+14], and Flickr30k [YLHH14].\nWe use the test set of COCO Karpathy split [KFF17], which re-partitions the train2014 and val2014\nimages [LMB+14] into 113,287, 5,000, and 5,000 for the training set, validation set, and test set,\nrespectively. We conduct an evaluation on Flickr30k\u2019s Karpathy split test set. The image resolution\nis 224\u00d7224. We use beam search to generate the captions, and the beam size is 5. In the few-shot\nsettings, we randomly sample demonstrations from the training set. We use COCOEvalCap4 to\ncompute CIDEr [VLZP15] and SPICE [AFJG16] scores as the evaluation metrics. We prompt\nKOSMOS-1 with \u201cAn image of\u201d for zero-shot and few-shot caption generation experiments.\n\nFor visual question-answering tasks, we evaluate zero-shot and few-shot results on test-dev set of\nVQAv2 [GKSS+17] and test-dev set of VizWiz [GLS+18], respectively. The resolution of images is\n224\u00d7224. We use greedy search for the decoding. We follow the normalization rules of the VQAv2\nevaluation code5 when computing the VQA accuracy. We evaluate the performance of VQA in an\nopen-ended setting that KOSMOS-1 generates answers and stops at the </s> (\u201cend of sequence\u201d)\ntoken. The prompt is \u201cQuestion: {question} Answer: {answer}\u201d for visual question answering tasks.\n\n4.1.2 Results\n\nImage Captioning Table 2 shows the zero-shot captioning performance on COCO Karpathy test\nsplit and Flickr30k test set. KOSMOS-1 achieves remarkable results in zero-shot setting on two image\ncaptioning datasets. Speci\ufb01cally, our model achieves a CIDEr score of 67.1 on the Flickr30k dataset,\ncompared to 60.6 and 61.5 for the Flamingo-3B and Flamingo-9B models, respectively. Notably, our\nmodel is able to accomplish this feat with a smaller size of 1.6B, compared to Flamingo models. This\ndemonstrates our model\u2019s superiority in zero-shot image captioning.\n\n4https://github.com/salaniz/pycocoevalcap\n5https://github.com/GT-Vision-Lab/VQA\n\n8\n\n\fModel\n\nCOCO\n\nFlickr30k\n\nCIDEr\n\nSPICE CIDEr\n\nSPICE\n\nZeroCap\nVLKD\nFewVLM\nMETALM\nFlamingo-3B\u2217\nFlamingo-9B\u2217\nKOSMOS-1 (1.6B)\n\n14.6\n58.3\n-\n82.2\n73.0\n79.4\n84.7\n\n5.5\n13.4\n-\n15.7\n-\n-\n16.8\n\n-\n-\n31.0\n43.4\n60.6\n61.5\n67.1\n\n-\n-\n10.0\n11.7\n-\n-\n14.5\n\nTable 2: Zero-shot image captioning results on COCO caption Karpathy test and Flickr30k test.\n\u2217 Flamingo [ADL+22] prompts with two examples from the downstream tasks while removing their\ncorresponding images (i.e., similar to few-shot text prompts).

Bottom: Evaluate KOSMOS-1 on Raven IQ test.\nThe input prompt consists of the \ufb02attened image matrix and verbal instruction. We append each\ncandidate image to the prompt separately and query the model if it is correct. The \ufb01nal prediction is\nthe candidate that motivates the model to yield the highest probability of \u201cYes\u201d.\n\n4.2\n\nIQ Test: Nonverbal Reasoning\n\nRaven\u2019s Progressive Matrices [CJS90, JR03] is one of the most common tests to evaluate nonverbal\nreasoning. The capability of nonverbal reasoning is typically a re\ufb02ection of an individual\u2019s intelligence\nquotient (IQ). Figure 4 shows an example. Given eight images presented in a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix, the task is\nto identify the following element from six similar candidates.\n\nThe models need to conduct zero-shot nonverbal reasoning without explicitly \ufb01ne-tuning. The Raven\nIQ test is analogous to in-context learning of language models, where the difference is whether the\ncontext is nonverbal or verbal. In order to infer the answers, the models have to recognize abstract\nconcepts and identify the underlying patterns of given images. So the IQ task is a good testbed to\nbenchmark the nonverbal in-context learning capability.\n\n10\n\n?ABCDEFExample of IQ TestABCDEF\ud835\udc43( Yes | Input Prompt )Which option can complete the matrix?Here are eight images:  Input PromptThe following image is:Is it correct?Is it correct?Is it correct?Is it correct?Is it correct?Is it correct?YesYesYesYesYesYes\f4.2.1 Evaluation Setup\n\nTo evaluate the KOSMOS-1 on zero-shot nonverbal reasoning, we construct a dataset of the Raven IQ\ntest. It consists of 50 examples collected from different websites6789. Each example has three (i.e.,\n2 \u00d7 2 matrix), four, or eight (i.e., 3 \u00d7 3 matrix) given images. The goal is to predict the next one. Each\ninstance has six candidate images with a unique correct completion. We measure accuracy scores to\nevaluate the models. The evaluation dataset is available at https://aka.ms/kosmos-iq50.\n\nFigure 4 illustrates how to evaluate KOSMOS-1 on the Raven IQ test. The matrix-style images are\n\ufb02attened and fed into the models one-by-one. To enable the model to better understand the desired\ntask, we also use a textual instruction \u201cHere are three/four/eight images:\u201d, \u201cThe following image is:\u201d,\nand \u201cIs it correct?\u201d for conditioning. We append each possible candidate to the context separately\nand compare the probability that the model outputs \u201cYes\u201d in a close-ended setting. The candidate that\nyields the largest probability is regarded as the prediction.\n\n4.2.2 Results\n\nTable 6 shows the evaluation results on the IQ test dataset. Both KOSMOS-1 with and without\nlanguage-only instruction tuning achieve 5.3% and 9.3% improvement respectively over the random\nbaseline. The results indicate that KOSMOS-1 is able to perceive abstract conceptual patterns in a\nnonverbal context, and then deduce the following element across multiple choices. To the best of\nour knowledge, it is the \ufb01rst time that a model can perform such zero-shot Raven IQ tests. Although\nthere is still a large performance gap between the current model and the average level of adults,\nKOSMOS-1 demonstrates the potential of MLLMs to perform zero-shot nonverbal reasoning by\naligning perception with language models.\n\nMethod\n\nAccuracy\n\nRandom Choice\nKOSMOS-1\nw/o language-only instruction tuning\n\n17%\n22%\n26%\n\nTable 6: Zero-shot generalization on Raven IQ test.\n\n4.3 OCR-Free Language Understanding\n\nOCR-free language understanding is a task that focuses on understanding text and images without\nrelying on Optical Character Recognition (OCR). For example, during the Rendered SST-2 task,\nsentences from the Stanford Sentiment Treebank [SPW+13] dataset are rendered as images. The\nmodel is asked to predict the sentiment of the text within the images. The task evaluates a model\u2019s\nability to read and comprehend the meaning of words and sentences directly from the images.\n\n4.3.1 Evaluation Setup\n\nWe evaluate OCR-free language understanding on the Rendered SST-2 [RKH+21] test set and\nHatefulMemes [KFM+20] validation set. We use accuracy as the metric for the Rendered SST-2 and\nreport ROC AUC for the HatefulMemes dataset. We use the prompt \u201cQuestion: what is the sentiment\nof the opinion? Answer: {answer}\u201d, where the answer is either positive or negative for the Rendered\nSST-2. For the HatefulMemes task, the prompt is \u201cQuestion: does this picture contain real hate\nspeech? Answer: {answer}\u201d, where the answer is either yes or no.\n\n4.3.2 Results\n\nAs shown in Table 7, KOSMOS-1 achieves a ROC AUC of 63.9% for the HatefulMemes validation\nIt outperforms CLIP ViT-L\nset and a test accuracy of 67.1% for the Rendered SST-2 test set.\n\n6https://en.testometrika.com/intellectual/iq-test/\n7https://en.testometrika.com/intellectual/iq-test-for-kids-7-to-16-year-old/\n8https://iqpro.org/\n9https://iqhaven.com/matrix-g\n\n11\n\n\fand Flamingo-9B, which achieve AUCs of 63.3% and 57.0% on the HatefulMemes task. Note\nthat Flamingo explicitly provides OCR text into the prompt, while KOSMOS-1 does not access\nany external tools or resources. This indicates that KOSMOS-1 has built-in abilities to read and\ncomprehend the text in the rendered images.\n\nModel\n\nHatefulMemes Rendered SST-2\n\nCLIP ViT-B/32\nCLIP ViT-B/16\nCLIP ViT-L/14\nFlamingo-3B\nFlamingo-9B\nKOSMOS-1 (1.6B)\n\n57.6\n61.7\n63.3\n53.7\n57.0\n63.9\n\n59.6\n59.8\n64.0\n-\n-\n67.1\n\nTable 7: Zero-shot generalization on OCR-free language understanding. We report accuracy scores.\n\n4.4 Web Page Question Answering\n\nWeb page question answering aims at \ufb01nding answers to questions from web pages. It requires the\nmodel to comprehend both the semantics and the structure of texts. The structure of the web page\n(such as tables, lists, and HTML layout) plays a key role in how the information is arranged and\ndisplayed. The task can help us evaluate our model\u2019s ability to understand the semantics and the\nstructure of web pages.\n\n4.4.1 Evaluation Setup\n\nWe compare the performance on the Web-based Structural Reading Comprehension (WebSRC)\ndataset [CZC+21]. For comparisons, we train a language model (LLM) on the same text corpora\nwith the same training setup as in KOSMOS-1. The LLM takes the text extracted from the web\npage as input. Its template of the prompt is \u201cGiven the context below from web page, extract the\nanswer from the given text like this: Qusestion: Who is the publisher of this book? Answer: Penguin\nBooks Ltd. Context: {WebText} Q: {question} A: {answer} \u201d, where the {WebText} presents the text\nextracted from the web page. Besides using the same prompt, KOSMOS-1 prepends the image before\nthe prompt. Two example images from WebSRC are shown in Appendix C.3. Following the original\npaper [CZC+21], we use exact match (EM) and F1 scores as our evaluation metrics.\n\n4.4.2 Results\n\nThe experimental results are summarized in Table 8. We observe that KOSMOS-1 outperforms the\nLLM, indicating that KOSMOS-1 can bene\ufb01t from the layout and style information of web pages in\nimages. In addition, we evaluate the performance of KOSMOS-1 without the extracted text in the\nprompt. It shows that extracted text has a contribution of +12.0/20.7 EM/F1 to KOSMOS-1, indicating\nthat the bene\ufb01t from modeling images does not sacri\ufb01ce its language abilities.\n\nModels\n\nEM\n\nF1\n\nUsing extracted text\nLLM\nKOSMOS-1\n\n7.6\n15.8\n\nWithout using extracted text\nKOSMOS-1\n\n3.8\n\n17.9\n31.3\n\n10.6\n\nTable 8: Zero-shot performance on WebSRC task.

Motivated by chain-of-thought prompting, we investigate\na multimodal chain-of-thought prompting using KOSMOS-1. As illustrated in Figure 5, we break\ndown perception-language tasks into two steps. In the \ufb01rst stage, given an image, we use a prompt to\nguide the model to generate a rationale. The model is then fed the rationale and a task-aware prompt\nto produce the \ufb01nal results.\n\n4.5.1 Evaluation Setup\n\nWe evaluate the ability of multimodal chain-of-thought prompting on the Rendered SST-2. We use the\nprompt \u201cIntroduce this picture in detail:\u201d to generate the content in the picture as the rationale. Then,\nwe use the prompt \u201c{rationale} Question: what is the sentiment of the opinion? Answer: {answer}\u201d\nto predict the sentiment, where the answer is either positive or negative.\n\n4.5.2 Results\n\nWe conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of the multimodal chain-of-thought prompting.\nTable 9 shows that multimodal chain-of-thought prompting achieves a score of 72.9, which is 5.8\npoints higher than the standard prompting. By generating intermediate content, the model can\nrecognize the text in the images and infer the sentiment of the sentences more correctly.\n\n4.6 Zero-Shot Image Classi\ufb01cation\n\nWe report the zero-shot image classi\ufb01cation performance on ImageNet [DDS+09]. Image classi\ufb01ca-\ntion comprehends an entire image as a whole and aims to assign a label to the image. We map each\nlabel to its category name in natural language. The model is prompted to predict the category name\nto perform zero-shot image classi\ufb01cation.\n\n13\n\nStandard PromptingIt is a robot that is holding up a cube that is the same color as the wall.The image is from the film, WALL-E, by Pixar Animation Studios.

The input\nis then fed into the model to obtain the category name of the image. We evaluate the model on\nImageNet [DDS+09], which contains 1.28M training images and 50k validation images in 1k object\ncategories. The prediction is classi\ufb01ed as correct if it is exactly the same as the ground-truth category\nname. The image resolution used for evaluation is 224\u00d7224. We use beam search to generate the\ncategory names and the beam size is 2.\n\n4.6.2 Results\n\nAs shown in Table 10, we report zero-shot results in both constrained and unconstrained settings.\nThe difference between the two settings is whether we use the 1k object category names to constrain\nthe decoding. KOSMOS-1 signi\ufb01cantly outperforms GIT [WYH+22] by 4.6% under the constrained\nsetting and 2.1% under the unconstrained setting.\n\nModel\nGIT [WYH+22]\nKOSMOS-1\n\nWithout Constraints With Constraints\n\n1.9\n4.0\n\n33.5\n38.1\n\nTable 10: Zero-shot image classi\ufb01cation on ImageNet.

We report top-1 accuracy scores.\n\n4.7 Zero-Shot Image Classi\ufb01cation with Descriptions\n\nThe standard approach of image classi\ufb01cation as above is to prompt the model for the speci\ufb01c name\nof the object depicted in the image. However, there are also some classi\ufb01cation rules customized for\ndifferent users and scenarios, such as the re\ufb01ned classi\ufb01cation of complex animal subspecies. We\ncan utilize natural language descriptions to guide KOSMOS-1 to distinguish images in the zero-shot\nsetting, which makes the decision process more interpretable.\n\n14\n\nQuestion:whatis the name of the woodpecker in the picture, three toed or downy?Answer:Input Prompt Completiondowny woodpeckerQuestion:whatis the name of the woodpecker in the picture?Answer:Input Prompt Description of three toed woodpecker: It has black and white stripes throughout the body and a yellow crown.Description of downy woodpecker: It has white spots on its black wings and some red on its crown.Completionthree toe woodpeckerZero-Shot ClassificationZero-Shot Classification with Descriptions\fCategory 1\n\nthree toed woodpecker\n\nCategory 2\n\ndowny woodpecker\n\nIt has black and white stripes\nthroughout the body and a yellow\ncrown.\n\nIt has white spots on its black wings\nand some red on its crown.\n\nGentoo penguin\n\nroyal penguin\n\nIt has a black head and white patch\nabove its eyes.\n\nIt has a white face and a yellow\ncrown.\n\nblack throated sparrow\n\nfox sparrow\n\nIt has white underparts and a dis-\ntinctive black bib on the throat.\n\nIt has a reddish-brown plumage and\na streaked breast.\n\nTable 11: The detailed descriptions of different categories for in-context image classi\ufb01cation.\n\n4.7.1 Evaluation Setup\n\nFollowing CUB [WBW+11], we construct a bird classi\ufb01cation dataset that contains images and\nnatural-language descriptions of categories. The dataset has three groups of binary image classi\ufb01ca-\ntion. Each group contains two animal categories with similar appearances. Our goal is to classify\nimages given the categories\u2019 descriptions. Table 11 presents the data samples. The \ufb01rst group is\nfrom [WBW+11], while the other two groups are collected from the website. Each category contains\ntwenty images.\n\nThe evaluation procedure is illustrated in Figure 6. For the zero-shot setting, we provide detailed\ndescriptions of two speci\ufb01c categories and use the template \u201cQuestion:what is the name of {general\ncategory} in the picture? Answer:\u201d to prompt the model for the speci\ufb01c category name in an open-\nended manner. To evaluate the effect of providing verbal descriptions in context, we also implement\na zero-shot baseline without prompting descriptions. Instead, we provide the corresponding speci\ufb01c\nnames in the prompt.\n\n4.7.2 Results\n\nThe evaluation results are shown in Table 12. We observe that providing descriptions in context can\nsigni\ufb01cantly improve the accuracy of image classi\ufb01cation. The consistent improvements indicate\nthat KOSMOS-1 can perceive the intentions of instructions and well align the concepts in language\nmodality with visual features in vision modality.\n\nSettings\n\nAccuracy\n\nWithout Descriptions\nWith Descriptions\n\n61.7\n90.0\n\nTable 12: Results of zero-shot image classi\ufb01cation without and with verbal descriptions.\n\n4.8 Language Tasks\n\nThe models are evaluated on the language tasks given task instructions (i.e., zero-shot) or several\ndemonstration examples (i.e., few-shot). Text inputs are directly fed into the models as in vanilla\nlanguage models.\n\n15\n\n\f4.8.1 Evaluation Setup\n\nWe train a language model (LLM) baseline with the same text corpora and training setup. We evaluate\nKOSMOS-1 and the LLM baseline on eight language tasks, including cloze and completion tasks (i.e,\nStoryCloze, HellaSwag), Winograd-style tasks (i.e, Winograd, Winogrande), commonsense reasoning\n(i.e, PIQA), and three datasets BoolQ, CB, and COPA from the SuperGLUE benchmark [WPN+19].\nThe detailed descriptions of these datasets are provided in Appendix C.2. We conduct experiments\nunder zero-shot and few-shot settings. We evaluate each test example by randomly sampling examples\nfrom the training set as demonstrations. We set the number of shots to 0, 1, and 4 in our experiments.\n\n4.8.2 Results\n\nTable 13 presents the in-context learning performance of language tasks. KOSMOS-1 achieves\ncomparable or even better performance in cloze completion and commonsense reasoning tasks\nwhen compared to LLM. In terms of the average result across all these datasets, LLM performs\nbetter in zero-shot and one-shot settings, whereas our model performs better in few-shot (k = 4)\nsettings. The results indicate that KOSMOS-1 also handles language-only tasks well and achieves\nfavorable performance across datasets. In addition, Section 4.9.2 shows that MLLMs learn better\nvisual commonsense knowledge compared with LLMs.\n\nTask\n\nStoryCloze\nHellaSwag\n\nWinograd\nWinogrande\n\nPIQA\n\nBoolQ\nCB\nCOPA\n\nAverage\n\nZero-shot\n\nOne-shot\n\nFew-shot (k = 4)\n\nLLM KOSMOS-1\n\nLLM KOSMOS-1\n\nLLM KOSMOS-1\n\n72.9\n50.4\n\n71.6\n56.7\n\n73.2\n\n56.4\n39.3\n68.0\n\n61.1\n\n72.1\n50.0\n\n69.8\n54.8\n\n72.9\n\n56.4\n44.6\n63.0\n\n60.5\n\n72.9\n50.2\n\n71.2\n56.7\n\n73.0\n\n55.1\n41.1\n69.0\n\n61.2\n\n72.2\n50.0\n\n68.4\n54.5\n\n72.5\n\n57.2\n48.2\n64.0\n\n60.9\n\n73.1\n50.4\n\n70.9\n57.0\n\n72.6\n\n58.7\n42.9\n69.0\n\n61.8\n\n72.3\n50.3\n\n69.8\n55.7\n\n72.3\n\n59.2\n53.6\n64.0\n\n62.2\n\nTable 13: Performance comparisons of language tasks between KOSMOS-1 and LLM. We use the\nsame textual data and training setup to reimplement a language model. Both models do not use\ninstruction tuning for fair comparisons.\n\n4.9 Cross-modal Transfer\n\nCross-modal transferability allows a model to learn from one modality (such as text, image, audio,\netc.) and transfer the knowledge to the other modalities. This skill can enable a model to perform\nvarious tasks across different modalities. In this part, we evaluate the cross-model transferability of\nKOSMOS-1 on several benchmarks.\n\n4.9.1 Transfer from Language to Multimodal: Language-Only Instruction Tuning\n\nTo evaluate the effect of language-only instruction tuning, we conduct an ablation study using four\ndatasets: COCO, Flickr30k, VQAv2, and VizWiz. These datasets consist of image captioning and\nvisual questions anwsering. The evaluation metrics are: CIDEr scores for COCO/Flickr30k and VQA\naccuracy for VQAv2/VizWiz.\n\nTable 14 shows the experimental results. Language-only instruction tuning boosts our model\u2019s\nperformance by 1.9 points on Flickr30k, 4.3 points on VQAv2, and 1.3 points on VizWiz. Our experi-\nments show that language-only instruction tuning can signi\ufb01cantly improve the model\u2019s instruction-\nfollowing capabilities across modalities. The results also indicate that our model can transfer the\ninstruction-following capability from language to other modalities.\n\n16\n\n\fModel\n\nCOCO Flickr30k VQAv2 VizWiz\n\nKOSMOS-1\nw/o language-only instruction tuning\n\n84.7\n87.6\n\n67.1\n65.2\n\n51.0\n46.7\n\n29.2\n27.9\n\nTable 14: Ablation study on language-only instruction tuning. We report CIDEr scores for COCO\nand Flickr30k, and VQA accuracy scores for VQAv2 and VizWiz.\n\n4.9.2 Transfer from Multimodal to Language: Visual Commonsense Reasoning\n\nVisual commonsense reasoning tasks require an understanding of the properties of everyday objects\nin the real world, such as color, size, and shape. These tasks are challenging for language models\nbecause they may require more information about object properties than what is available in texts.\nTo investigate the visual commonsense capabilities, we compare the zero-shot performance of\nKOSMOS-1 and LLM on visual commonsense reasoning tasks.\n\nEvaluation Setup We compare KOSMOS-1 and the LLM baseline on three object com-\nmonsense reasoning datasets, RELATIVESIZE [BHCF16], MEMORYCOLOR [NHJ21] and COL-\nORTERMS [BBBT12] datasets. Table 15 shows some examples of object size and color reasoning\ntasks. RELATIVESIZE contains 486 object pairs from 41 physical objects. The model is required to\npredict the size relation between two objects in a binary question-answering format with \u201cYes\u201d/\u201cNo\u201d\nanswers. MEMORYCOLOR and COLORTERMS require the model to predict the color of objects from\na set of 11 color labels in a multiple-choice format. We use only text as our input and do not include\nany images. We measure the accuracy of our model on these three datasets.\n\nTask\n\nExample Prompt\n\nObject / Pair Answer\n\nObject Size Reasoning\nObject Color Reasoning\n\nIs {Item1} larger than {Item2}? {Answer}\nThe color of {Object} is? {Answer}\n\n(sofa, cat)\nthe sky\n\nYes\nblue\n\nTable 15: Evaluation examples of object size and color reasoning.\n\nResults Table 16 presents the zero-shot performance of KOSMOS-1 and LLM on visual common-\nsense reasoning tasks. KOSMOS-1 signi\ufb01cantly outperforms LLM by 1.5% on RELATIVESIZE,\n14.7% on MEMORYCOLOR, and 9.7% on COLORTERMS dataset. The consistent improvements\nindicate that KOSMOS-1 bene\ufb01ts from the visual knowledge to complete the corresponding visual\ncommonsense reasoning. The reason for KOSMOS-1\u2019s superior performance is that it has modality\ntransferability, which enables the model to transfer visual knowledge to language tasks. On the\ncontrary, LLM has to rely on textual knowledge and clues to answer visual commonsense questions,\nwhich limits its ability to reason about object properties.\n\nModel\n\nSize Reasoning\nRELATIVESIZE MEMORYCOLOR COLORTERMS\n\nColor Reasoning\n\nUsing retrieved images\n\nVALM [WDC+23]\n\n85.0\n\nLanguage-only zero-shot evaluation\n\nLLM\nKOSMOS-1\n\n92.7\n94.2\n\n58.6\n\n61.4\n76.1\n\n52.7\n\n63.4\n73.1\n\nTable 16: Zero-shot visual commonsense reasoning on RELATIVESIZE, MEMORYCOLOR, and\nCOLORTERMS datasets.

The models trained on web-scale\n\n17\n\n\fmultimodal corpora achieve promising results across a wide range of language tasks and multimodal\ntasks. We show that going from LLMs to MLLMs enables new capabilities and opportunities. In\nthe future, we would like to scale up KOSMOS-1 in terms of model size [MWH+22, WMH+22,\nCDH+22], and integrate the speech [WCW+23] capability into KOSMOS-1. In addition, KOSMOS-1\ncan be used as a uni\ufb01ed interface for multimodal learning, e.g., enabling using instructions and\nexamples to control text-to-image generation.\n\nReferences\n[ADL+22] Jean-Baptiste Alayrac, Jeff Donahue, Pauline Luc, Antoine Miech, Iain Barr, Yana\nHasson, Karel Lenc, Arthur Mensch, Katherine Millican, Malcolm Reynolds, Roman\nRing, Eliza Rutherford, Serkan Cabi, Tengda Han, Zhitao Gong, Sina Samangooei, Mar-\nianne Monteiro, Jacob Menick, Sebastian Borgeaud, Andrew Brock, Aida Nematzadeh,\nSahand Sharifzadeh, Mikolaj Binkowski, Ricardo Barreira, Oriol Vinyals, Andrew\nZisserman, and Karen Simonyan.

The Pile is an 800 GB English\ntext corpus combining 22 diverse sources. We select a subset with seven sources from The Pile.\nCommon Crawl is also included in training corpora. Common Crawl takes snapshots of the web,\nwhich contains massive amounts of language data. Table 20 provides a full overview of the language\ndatasets that were used in the training of KOSMOS-1 model. These data sources can be divided into\nthe following three categories:\n\n\u2022 Academic: NIH Exporter\n\n\u2022 Internet: Pile-CC, OpenWebText2, Wikipedia (English), CC-2020-50, CC-2021-04, Realnews\n\u2022 Prose: BookCorpus2, Books3, Gutenberg [RPJ+20], CC-Stories\n\nDatasets\n\nTokens (billion) Weight (%) Epochs\n\nOpenWebText2\nCC-2021-04\nBooks3\nCC-2020-50\nPile-CC\nRealnews\nWikipedia\nBookCorpus2\nGutenberg (PG-19)\nCC-Stories\nNIH ExPorter\n\n14.8\n82.6\n25.7\n68.7\n49.8\n21.9\n4.2\n1.5\n2.7\n5.3\n0.3\n\n21.8%\n17.7%\n16.2%\n14.7%\n10.6%\n10.2%\n5.4%\n1.1%\n1.0%\n1.0%\n0.2%\n\n1.47\n0.21\n0.63\n0.21\n0.21\n0.46\n1.29\n0.75\n0.38\n0.19\n0.75\n\nTable 20: Language datasets used to train the KOSMOS-1 model.\n\nB.1.2\n\nImage-Caption Pairs\n\nKOSMOS-1 is trained on image-caption pairs constructed from several datasets, including English\nLAION-2B [SBV+22], LAION-400M [SVB+21], COYO-700M [BPK+22] and Conceptual Cap-\ntions [SDGS18, CSDS21]. LAION-2B, LAION-400M, and COYO-700M datasets are extracted by\nparsing out image URLs and alt-texts of web pages from the Common Crawl web data. LAION-2B\ncontains about 2B English image-caption pairs, LAION-400M consists of 400M English image-\ncaption pairs, and COYO-700M has 700M English image-caption pairs. Conceptual Captions contains\n15M English image-caption pairs and consists of two datasets: CC3M and CC12M, which are also\ncollected from internet webpages using a Flume pipeline. For Conceptual Captions, we discard pairs\nwhose captions contain special tags such as \u201c<PERSON>\u201d.\n\nB.1.3\n\nInterleaved Data\n\nWe collect a large corpus of 2 billion web pages from the snapshots of common crawls. To ensure\nquality and relevance, we apply several \ufb01ltering criteria. First, we discard any pages that are not\nwritten in English. Second, we discard any pages that do not have images interspersed in the text.\nThird, we discard any images that have a resolution lower than 64 by 64 pixels or that are single-\ncolored. Fourth, we discard any text that is not meaningful or coherent, such as spam or gibberish.\nWe use some heuristics to identify and remove gibberish text containing emoji symbols, hashtags,\nand URL links. After applying these \ufb01lters, we end up with about 71 million documents for training.\n\nB.2 Data Format\n\nThe training data is organized in the format as follows:\n\n24\n\n\fDatasets\n\nText\n\nImage-Caption\n\nMultimodal\n\nFormat Examples\n\n<s> KOSMOS-1 can perceive multimodal input, learn in context, and gener-\nate output. </s>\n<s> <image> Image Embedding </image> WALL-E giving potted plant to\nEVE. </s>\n<s> <image> Image Embedding </image> This is WALL-E. <image>\nImage Embedding </image> This is EVE. </s>\n\nTable 21: The examples of the data format to train the KOSMOS-1 model.\n\nC Evaluation\n\nC.1\n\nInput Format Used for Perception-Language Tasks\n\nFigure 7 shows how we conduct zero-shot and few-shot evaluations on perception-language tasks.\n\nFigure 7: We evaluate KOSMOS-1 on the perception-language tasks in zero- and few-shot settings.
